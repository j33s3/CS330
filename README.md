### 1. How do I approach designing software

In regard to project two, I have learned to start by finding a reference in the real world. This way, I can get a close-up of all the angles of the objects. After this, it is important to break the object down into its most primitive shapes. Breaking the object down will make designing a much simpler task. After defining the objects in the scene, I had to draw them out in the OpenGL render. During this phase, I would scale, transform, and rotate the object to my liking. Once the shape was on par, I created textures to match the scene. Finally, I played around with lighting; this took a significant amount of trial and error. Again, referring to the reference to the scene, I was able to gather information from the real-life scene to guide my decisions in the lighting colors.
  
### 2. How do I approach developing programs

I have had some experience with 3D modeling in the past. However, that experience was with Blender. Modeling using OpenGL is significantly harder and limited in how detailed you can get while still being efficient. This project has strengthened my observation skills. In other words, I have become more keen on breaking complex objects into smaller pieces. This project was also a good time for me to become familiar with higher-level math and programming. In order to render the napkins in the holder, I needed to know what the X and Y coords should be so they lined up. For this, I used the tan() function to find the X and Y coords.

### 3. How can computer science help me reach my goals

Computer science, and more specifically, computation graphics, will help me to create applications that I think of. The more that I learn about computer science, the more feasible my ideas become. Computational graphics and visualization will help me achieve my goals of creating an indie video game and developing graphically pleasing and interactive web experiences. I will take advantage of my knowledge in designing, interactivity, texturing, lighting, and shading.
